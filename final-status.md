# Final Status Check

## All Features Working:
1. **Skills Form** - Simplified to plain list, no proficiency levels. Each skill is just an input + X button. "Add Skill" button at bottom. ✅
2. **Color Picker** - Accent color popover with preset swatches + custom color input + native color picker. Updates resume preview in real-time. ✅
3. **JSON Export** - "JSON exported" toast shown, downloads JSON file. ✅
4. **PDF Export** - "PDF downloaded successfully" toast shown, downloads PDF. ✅
5. **Section Order** - Drag-and-drop reorder tab with 5 draggable sections (Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Certifications). ✅
6. **Dark Mode Toggle** - Button in toolbar. ✅
7. **Horizontal Tabs** - Personal, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Certs, Order. ✅
8. **Template Switching** - Classic, Modern, Executive all working. ✅
9. **Auto-save** - "Auto-saved to browser" indicator shown. ✅

## Remaining Issues:
- The form panel scrolls properly now (Skills tab shows all 8 skills + Add button visible)
- Need to verify the scroll works on tabs with lots of content (Experience, Projects)
- Need to test dark mode toggle visually
