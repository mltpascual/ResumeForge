## Brand Voice

ResumeForge communicates with a tone that is **confident, helpful, and direct**. The product speaks as a knowledgeable career advisor — never condescending, never vague. Copy should feel like guidance from a trusted colleague who has reviewed hundreds of resumes.

## Tone Spectrum

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Headings & CTAs | Bold, action-oriented | "Build resumes that actually work." |
| Feature descriptions | Clear, benefit-focused | "Ten layouts designed for ATS compatibility and visual impact." |

| Empty states | Encouraging, instructive | "No experience entries yet. Add your first position to get started." |
| Success feedback | Brief, affirming | "Entry duplicated." / "Resume exported." |
| Tooltips & tips | Concise, actionable | "Use action verbs like Led, Built, Designed to strengthen bullet points." |

## Terminology

| Preferred Term | Avoid | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Resume | CV (unless academic context) | Primary US market terminology |
| Template | Theme, skin, layout | Consistent with industry standard |
| Export | Download, save as | Describes the action accurately |
| Entry | Item, record, card | User-friendly for form sections |
| Section | Block, area, module | Matches resume terminology |
| ATS | Applicant Tracking System (on first use, abbreviate after) | Common industry abbreviation |

## Error Message Conventions

Error messages follow a three-part structure: **What happened**, **Why it matters**, and **What to do next**. Keep messages under 20 words when possible.

## User-Facing Copy Standards

All user-facing text should be sentence case (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns). Button labels should be 1-3 words maximum. Placeholder text in inputs should describe the expected format, not repeat the label.

## Toast Notifications

Toasts are used for non-blocking confirmations. They should disappear after 3 seconds, use the Sonner library, and never require user interaction to dismiss.
