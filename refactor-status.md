# Refactor Status

## What's working:
1. Editor loads with sample data pre-populated (auto-saved from previous session)
2. Executive template is displayed with accent color applied to header
3. Horizontal tabs are visible: Personal, Experience, Education, Skills, Projects, Certs, Order
4. Top bar has: Sample, Clear, Template selector (Classic/Modern/Executive), accent color picker, upload, dark mode toggle, print, JSON export, PDF export
5. Form panel has proper scroll area
6. Preview panel shows the Executive template with accent color

## Still need to test:
- Skills form (should be simple list now)
- Scroll behavior with many items
- Color picker functionality
- Dark mode toggle
- JSON import/export
- PDF export
