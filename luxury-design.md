# Luxury / Refined UI — Design System

## Design Philosophy
**"Black Tie Elegance"** — Inspired by luxury fashion houses, high-end jewelry branding, and five-star hotel aesthetics. Every element should feel like it belongs in a Cartier catalog or a Ritz-Carlton lobby.

## Core Principles
1. **Restrained Opulence**: Dark, moody surfaces with strategic gold/champagne accents
2. **Typographic Authority**: Serif display fonts that command attention, paired with refined sans-serif body text
3. **Negative Space as Luxury**: Generous whitespace signals exclusivity and confidence
4. **Material Richness**: Subtle gradients, glass effects, and fine borders that evoke precious materials

## Color Philosophy
- **Primary Surface**: Deep charcoal/near-black (#0A0A0B) — like polished obsidian
- **Card Surface**: Dark slate (#141418) — elevated surfaces with subtle warmth
- **Gold Accent**: Champagne gold (#C9A96E) — the signature luxury touch, used sparingly
- **Gold Light**: (#E8D5A8) — lighter gold for hover states
- **Text Primary**: Warm white (#F5F0E8) — not pure white, slightly warm like cream paper
- **Text Secondary**: Muted silver (#8A8A95) — for supporting text
- **Border**: Subtle gold-tinted borders (#2A2A30) — barely visible structure
- **Success**: Muted emerald (#4A9E7A)
- **Destructive**: Muted ruby (#C45C5C)

## Typography System
- **Display**: "Cormorant Garamond" — elegant, high-contrast serif for headlines
- **Body**: "Inter" weight 300-400 — clean, modern, light-weight for readability on dark
- **Mono/Labels**: "Inter" weight 500, letter-spacing 0.1em — for small caps labels

## Layout Paradigm
- Full-bleed dark backgrounds
- Content contained in max-width with generous padding
- Cards with very subtle borders and slight elevation
- Asymmetric hero with dramatic scale contrast

## Signature Elements
1. **Gold accent lines** — thin 1px gold dividers and underlines
2. **Frosted glass panels** — backdrop-blur on editor panels
3. **Subtle grain texture** — noise overlay on dark surfaces for depth

## Interaction Philosophy
- Smooth, deliberate transitions (300-500ms ease)
- Gold shimmer on hover states
- Fade-in entrance animations
- Button hover: subtle gold glow/border
- Input focus: gold border transition

## Animation Guidelines
- Entrance: fade-up with 400ms ease-out
- Hover: 200ms color/border transitions
- Page transitions: crossfade 300ms
- Scroll reveals: staggered fade-in
